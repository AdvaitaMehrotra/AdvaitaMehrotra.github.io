       <p> Limerick-
        
        There once was a grand old flag, 
        Who used to be a rag,
        Then citizens got loyal,
        He started to feel royal, 
        But WW2 became  a drag.</p>
        
        
       <p> Couplet-
        
        I felt a cold breeze,
        Which made me freeze.</p>
        
        
        <p>Haiku -
        
        Cats are very cute,
        But are amazing hunters,
        And are awesome pets.</p>
        
        
       <p> Cinquain-
        
                             <p>Bird</p>
                        <p>Fast, quick</p>
            <p>Running, racing, sprinting</p>
        <p>Runs even in the hottest desert, </p>
                     <p>  Roadrunner. </p>
        </p>
       <h2> Other poems by me </h2>
        
        <p>Rain- 
        At first it was pretty crazy. Rain in the burning hot sun? Next we got umbrellas and we were walking in the rain, but soon the rain convinced the sun to go,
        making it as cold as snow!
         it was a hail storm. Ice was falling on umbrellas as loud as an airplane. it was huge, really huge. Heil the hail storm! </p> 
        
        
        <p>The ocean- </p>
        <p>Giant with amazing surprises, deep down in the ocean, nature will surprise you. Unexplored trenches await, go down if you dare, but BEWARE of the ferocious beasts and giant animals that might be down there, or microscopic animals. I would be careful if I were you.</p>
        <p> This is a poem that I have made about coronavirus. It is in the future, when the cure was invented.</p>
        <p> Oh, it was the age of the virus,
            <p>A cure was desirous,</p>
           <p> And everyone was cooped up at home,</p>
           <p> Not even vendors dared to roam,</p>
           <p>We stayed in a lockdown,</p>
           <p>And if you stayed in uptown,</p>
           <p>Every day was a letdown,</p>
           <p>We connected with nature instead of the internet,</p>
           <p>But still wondered if the virus had left our world yet.</p>
           <p>But that day when the news came,</p>
           <p>Everyone was elated!</p>
           <p>The crisis was understated!</p>
           <p>We were strong enough.</p>
           <p> But every day we think about the life lessons we learned,</p>
           <p> It was a lot we earned.</p>
           <p>But we also suffered losses,</p>
           <p>Large, large losses,</p>
            <p>But this has taught us to stay strongâ€¦
              
            </p>
