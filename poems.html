       <p> Limerick
        
        There once was a grand old flag, 
        Who used to be a rag,
        Then citizens got loyal,
        He started to feel royal, 
        But WW2 became  a drag.</p>
        
        
       <p> Couplet
        
        I felt a cold breeze,
        Which made me freeze.</p>
        
        
        <p>Haiku 
        
        Cats are very cute,
        But are amazing hunters,
        And are awesome pets.</p>
        
        
       <p> Cinquain
        
                             Bird
                        Fast, quick
            Running, racing, sprinting,
        Runs even in the hottest desert, 
                       Roadrunner.

        <p>Rain 
        At first it was pretty crazy. Rain in the burning hot sun? Next we got umbrellas and we were walking in the rain, but soon the rain convinced the sun to go,
        making it as cold as snow!
         it was a hail storm. Ice was falling on umbrellas as loud as an airplane. it was huge, really huge. Heil the hail storm! </p> 
        
        
        <p>The ocean </p>
        <p>Giant with amazing surprises, deep down in the ocean, nature will surprise you. Unexplored trenches await, go down if you dare, but BEWARE of the ferocious beasts and giant animals that might be down there, or microscopic animals. I would be careful if I were you.</p>
