                <p> Hi! My name is Advaita. Welcome to my website.
                  My first post on this blog is about the microscale lego city I've been working on.
                  The city has a plan and you can see it very well in the photo. It has the suburbs at the far left, there is a midtown close to it, and where all the huge skyscrapers are is the downtown with the tallest building (the white one)at around 4 feet! The next place is on the other side of the city, with a midtown and airport, with better quality housing and offices.
          My favorite building is the white one, also the tallest building in the city. I also like the houses that are the river, on the top left. The orange on is a hotel, and the other one is a mansion. </p>

          <h1>My LEGO tecnic</h1>
          <P>Hi! This is my next poston the blog. I am going to be writing about my LEGO tecnic set, the 24-hours race car (42039 is the set number) . It is a very cool set, it is  around 2 feet long and has lots and lots of gears. The set is motorised and I can make it's doors open and I can also make the back open to reveal it's lego V8 engine. I like how realistic it looks very realistic. It takes a lot of time to build it, though. I took a month to make it. But the end result was worth it. I think that the car is an amazing set to get. <img src="IMG_2412.JPG" alt="photo of the set" width="40%"><img src="IMG2431.JPG" alt="photo of the set" width="40%"><img src="IMG_2414.JPG" alt="photo of the set" width="40%" ><img src="IMG_2417.JPG" alt="tecnic" width="40%" > <img src="IMG_2418.jpg" alt="tecnic" ></P>
