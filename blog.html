                <p> Hi! My name is Advaita. Welcome to my website.
                  My first post on this blog is about the microscale lego city I've been working on.
                  The city has a plan and you can see it very well in the photo. It has the suburbs at the far left, there is a midtown close to it, and where all the huge skyscrapers are is the downtown with the tallest building (the white one)at around 4 feet! The next place is on the other side of the city, with a midtown and airport, with better quality housing and offices.
          My favorite building is the white one, also the tallest building in the city. I also like the houses that are the river, on the top left. The orange on is a hotel, and the other one is a mansion. </p>
