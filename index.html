		<h1>  Advaita Mehrotra- Welcome to my world </h1>
		<p> Hi! My name is Advaita. Welcome to my website.
			My first post is about the microscale lego city i've been working on.
			The city has a plan and you can see it very well in the photo. It has the suburbs at the far left, there is a midtown close to it, and where all the huge skyscrapers are is the downtown with the tallest building (the white one)at around 4 feet! The next place is on the other side of the city, with a midtown and airport, with better quality housing and offices.
	My favorite building is the white one, also the tallest building in the city. I also like the houses in the river, on the top left. The orange on is a hotel, and the other one is a mansion.
